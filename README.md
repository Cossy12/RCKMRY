Stack  AND FRAMEWORK
NextJS
Typescript
TailwindCSS
GraphQL


Project Setup:
Create a new Next.js project using create-next-app.
Set up Tailwind CSS for styling.
Install necessary GraphQL packages for data fetching and management.



GraphQL Setup:
Define GraphQL schema and queries based on the requirements of the Rick and Morty API.
Set up GraphQL client to fetch data from the Rick and Morty API.
Utilize Apollo Client or another GraphQL client library to handle GraphQL queries and mutations.


Component Structure:
Plan the component structure of the web app, including pages, layouts, and reusable components.
Utilize Next.js's routing system to create pages for different sections of the app.


Data Fetching:
Utilize GraphQL for data fetching instead of REST. GraphQL allows for more efficient data retrieval by enabling clients to request only the data they need. This is particularly beneficial when dealing with complex data structures like those in the Rick and Morty API.
Integrate the Rick and Morty GraphQL API into the project. GraphQL's flexible querying capabilities make it easier to fetch specific data fields and reduce over-fetching compared to REST.


UI Development:
Design and develop the user interface using Tailwind CSS. Tailwind CSS provides a utility-first approach to styling, making it easier to create responsive and customizable UI components.
Implement various components such as character cards, episode lists, and search functionality using React components within the Next.js framework.


State Management:
Utilize local storage to store user preferences or data that needs to persist across sessions. For example, storing user notes of characters.
Manage application state using React's built-in state management capabilities or third-party libraries like Redux if the application complexity demands it.

Functionality Implementation:
Implement features such as character search, episode filtering, and location browsing.
Handle user interactions and input validation.
Utilize local storage to store user preferences or session data, such as notes of  characters.


Routing:
Utilize Next.js's built-in routing system for client-side navigation between pages. This allows for seamless page transitions and code splitting, improving overall performance.


Deploy the application to a hosting platform like Vercel  which offer seamless integration with Next.js projects and provide features like automatic deployments and serverless functions.


Why GraphQL over REST:
Flexible Data Retrieval: GraphQL allows clients to specify exactly what data they need, reducing over-fetching and under-fetching of data compared to REST.
Single Endpoint: With GraphQL, there's typically a single endpoint for all data queries, which simplifies the API surface and reduces the need for multiple endpoints for different use cases.
Strongly Typed Schema: GraphQL's schema definition language provides a clear contract between the client and server, making it easier to understand and work with the API.
Graphical Querying: GraphQL's graphical query interface allows developers to explore the schema and test queries interactively, improving the development experience.










This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
